# Regression

Can you use data to allocate your advertising budget best to maximize sales? Can you predict real-estate prices from property data? We will build one of the most used models for answering such questions: Regression. This workshop will teach several key concepts in data science: statistical models, multi-linear regression, testing, and interpreting models.

At the end of this workshop, you will understand basic statistical models to tackle beginner data science prediction projects and implement them in Python (using Scikit, matplotlib, etc.). The homework will then exercise the skills you learned. We will discuss the homework on our community forum.

Here is the outline:
1. What is Regression
2. Scoring models
3. Code block A: 1D fit
4. Multi-linear regression
5. Code block B: MLR model fit 
6. Code block C: California Real Estate Dataset 
7. General paradigm: Model family, loss families
8. Bonus material: Interpreting linear models?

You will model and solve a real-world linear regression problem. Finally, a homework problem will help cement your understanding!

# What more should you read and do?

- First, do the homework and discuss it on our [community forums](https://discourse.univ.ai/). Feel free to ask any and all questions there.
- For further practice pick any additional dataset and run through the same exercise. If you are not sure, feel free to pick one from [this list](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php?format=&task=reg&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=&sort=nameUp&view=table).
- Practice the optional code blocks and slides on interpreting linear regression models. 
- If you would like to learn more our AI-1 course digs deep into regression models and their use and interpretations.
